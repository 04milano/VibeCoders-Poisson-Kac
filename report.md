# Poisson-Kac Task 1

In this task, we simulate N random event times distributed uniformly within a time interval [0,T] to model velocity reversal events in a Poisson-Kac process. We calculate the time intvervals $\tau$ between successive reversal events and demonstrate that their probability density function p($\tau$) follows an exponential distribution given by $p(\tau) = \mu e^{-\mu\tau}$. Here the rate parameter is defined as  $\mu = N/T$.

## Layout of the algorithm, functions to be created

The code for this task relies on numpy to generate random numbers and to make array operations. It also uses matplotlib.pyplot to visualise. The two main functions of this task are:

      def generate_poisson_intervals(N,T):
            # It generates N random event times in the interval [0,T]
            # and sorts them. The function also calculates the time
            # differences tau between consecutive events.
            return tau

      def main_function():
            # This function ist used to coordinate the simulation, to
            # calculate mu, plot the histogram against the theoretical
            # distribution and to save the resulting figure.

## How to run the code

To run the code, you need to install numpy and matplotlib in your active Python environment and execute:

      python3 task1.py

N and T are predefined. So you don't need to define them.

## Resulting files

task1_distribution.png: This is a generated figure which shows the comparison between the histogram of simulated time intervals $\tau$ and the theoretical exponantial distribution curve.

## Successful tests

It has been verified that all generated event times are within the inteerval between 0 and T.
We can confirm that all calculated time intervals $\tau$ are positive numbers.
The area under the probability density histogram normalizes to 1 and aligns with the theoretical rate $\mu = N/T$. This was checked numerically and visually.

## Problems

Initial environment path conflicts, package resolution issues (numpy/matplotlib) within VS Code, and minor import errors (matplotlib vs matplotlib.pyplot). All issues were successfully resolved.

## Results (speed tests etc.)

The resulting plot clearly shows that the theoretical exponantial decay curve is closely followed by the simulated data points, validation the relation $\mu = N/T$.
